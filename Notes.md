### NOTES FOR MIDTERM

## GIT NOTES 
* git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example.git

* If we run the fetch Git command, you will get the latest information about the changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repository. We then run the status Git command to see the differences between the clones and see that we are missing a commit. You can pull it down using the pull Git command. You can also use the Git functionality in VS Code to view the status and sync up your repository.

* This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process.

* Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
* Make changes to the code
* Commit the changes (git commit)
* Push the changes to GitHub (git push)
